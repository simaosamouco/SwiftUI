# SwiftUI


In iOS development,  when it comes to creating intuitive and user friendly user interfaces SwiftUI is the state of the art.
In order to keep up to date in the iOS development world I’ve decided to take this SwiftUI Course. 
This course teaches SwiftUI in a hands-on project-based way, covering topics  like concurrency, Core Data, Combine, complex animations, notifications and even the newly announced SwiftData to persist data. 
To track my progress through the course I’ve decided to create this repository where I’ll be uploading the projects developed during the duration of the course along with updating the README file with a brief description of the project.

<h3 align="center">Restart App</h3>
 
In this module, I explored advanced app design, including complex SwiftUI gestures, amazing parallax effects, great animations and touched in topic of navigation. I also grasped the significance of an app icon for making a memorable first impression and the importance of creating one for App Store uploads.

<h3 align="center">Pinch & Zoom</h3>

 In this Pinch & Zoom module, I built an advanced SwiftUI gestures app. It was a fun journey where I got the hang of pinch and zoom features. We covered various cool gestures like long-press, double-tap, drag, and magnification gestures (for zooming in), almost all of them except for rotation.
We also checked out how to add a cool blur effect with color vibrancy to a view that's behind another view using SwiftUI materials. It's like adding a see-through layer to jazz up the background.

<h3 align="center">Africa</h3>

In this section, I delved into new programming concepts and explored the latest SwiftUI features. Covered topics like JSON handling, advanced grid layouts, MapKit integration, video players, and launch screen design. I also learned Swift programming concepts like extensions and generics and learned to prototype full applications with SwiftUI. The journey included creating professional looking iOS app, complex layout systems, and tab menus, along with transitioning iPadOS apps to macOS using Mac.

<h3 align="center">Devote</h3>
In this app I delved into iOS app development with SwiftUI and Core Data integration, focusing on creating a task manager app with a personal touch. I explored Core Data's role and how to integrate it seamlessly into the app. Topics included creating Widgets, database operations, UI customization and Light and Dark mode switching for a better user experience.

<h3 align="center">Fructus</h3>
In this module, embarking on the "FRUCTUS" project, I dived into SwiftUI 2.0, where I uncovered awesome new features. Through this module, I not only learned how to create an appealing onboarding and detail screen but also mastered data management and custom view design. 
In this module I delved into topics like how to retrieve local data using Structs, how to use the new AppStorage in SwiftUI and how to use scroll view, horizontal view, and vertical view containers.
One of the key takeaways from this module was the ability to set up a SwiftUI app from scratch, empowering me to craft a remarkable onboarding screen, complete with a user-friendly option to restart the app as needed. This project also shed light on the critical aspects of app structure, the pivotal role of icons, and the art of working with image assets.

<h3 align="center">Hike App</h3>
 
 In this module, I learned how to personalize app icons in my SwiftUI app, allowing users to pick their favorites for a unique touch. I also got hands-on experience with various layout containers, like horizontal and vertical stacks, and the versatile ZStack. Additionally, I dived into gradient and motion animations, mastering linear gradients and creating complex motion animations. The module also covered the use of SF Symbols, with its array of icons, and the importance of designing a striking app icon for iPhones and iPads to make a great first impression.

<h3 align="center">Touchdown App</h3>
 
In the "Touchdown" app project, I built a modern E-commerce mobile application with SwiftUI. The journey covered various programming concepts, such as data sharing, custom shapes, and dynamic layouts. We designed a professional app icon, created product grids, and optimised the app for different screen sizes, offering a comprehensive learning experience in E-commerce app development with SwiftUI.
