# SwiftUI


In iOS development,  when it comes to creating intuitive and user friendly user interfaces SwiftUI is the state of the art.
In order to keep up to date in the iOS development world I’ve decided to take this SwiftUI Course. 
This course teaches SwiftUI in a hands-on project-based way, covering topics  like concurrency, Core Data, Combine, complex animations, notifications and even the newly announced SwiftData to persist data. 
To track my progress through the course I’ve decided to create this repository where I’ll be uploading the projects developed during the duration of the course along with updating the README file with a brief description of the project.

 In this module, I learned how to personalize app icons in my SwiftUI app, allowing users to pick their favorites for a unique touch. I also got hands-on experience with various layout containers, like horizontal and vertical stacks, and the versatile ZStack. Additionally, I dived into gradient and motion animations, mastering linear gradients and creating complex motion animations. The module also covered the use of SF Symbols, with its array of icons, and the importance of designing a striking app icon for iPhones and iPads to make a great first impression.
